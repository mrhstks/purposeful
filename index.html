<h2>LETS GET STARTED!</h2>
  
<intro>
<p>I have been in college since 2017. 
My journey through college has been a long one; containing many bumps.
I am currently studying film at George Mason University while obtaining 
a minor in English and a concentration in Post Production. I've been in college since 2017, 
and hope to graduate within the next year and a half. So many times I wanted to give up 
on this education journey, but whenever I considered it, I didn't feel right. 
So I keep pressing forward.</p>
