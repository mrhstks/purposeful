<h3>Who Am I???</h3>

<Intro>
<p>Born in Manhatten, New York, I have managed to live a very colorful life during my 25 years on earth. As a child, 
I lived in several states, but I spent most of my life in the state of Virginia.
This kind of movement exposed me to so many kinds of ideas and people; it was here that began to develop a love for the creative arts.
I've been exposed to so many amazing experiences, both professionally and exclusively as a hobby. 
Yet, some of my greatest accomplishments include: marrying the man of my dreams, and the birth of our daughter. 
Along with my relationship with GOD, those two life events have had the greatest impact on how I view the world. </p>
<h3>My goal as a wife, a mom, a creative, and a human is to Love GOD, Love Others, and Love Myself... 
and if something artistic happens then that's cool too</h3>
